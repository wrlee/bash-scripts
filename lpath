## List path components of a search path environment variable
pathvar=${1:-PATH}
echo Path list for \"$pathvar\":
# eval echo \$$pathvar|sed 's/^/\t/;s/:/\n\t/g'
#eval echo \$$pathvar|sed 's/^/   /;s/:/\
#   /g'
## The following would be preferable, but it isn't supported by
## many non-bash shells and its existence can yield a syntax error
# echo ${!pathvar}|sed 's/^/   /;s/:/\n   /g'
## Universal implementation (relies on eval)
eval echo \$$pathvar|sed 's/^/   /;s/:/\n   /g' #|tr ":" "\012"
